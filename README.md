# CI587 - "Computer Wizard" JavaScript/Phaser 2D Game
This is a tile based 2D web game that I made for my 2nd year JavaScript module using the Phaser game framework. It is inspired by the 1989 Puzzle game Chip's Challenge. You play as a Wizard who is seeking computer parts. Collect all the parts and CPU on the motherboard to complete the game. Features item counter, timer, items that affect character speed, high-scores on end screen, and sound effects. All tile textures are created by me. 

WASD to move, CPU can only be collected when other 5 parts are collected.
